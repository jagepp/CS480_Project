# CS480_Project
This project will focus on data storage and minipulation for users playinng the game "Destiny 2". In this game, players collect items such as weapons, armor, and cosmetics. These items can be accessed online using an API, but there is no clear option to sort or search in a meaningful way. Players will want to save and store gear sets with specific stats, quickly find a weapon that has certain perks, and much more.
