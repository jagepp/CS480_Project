# CS480_Project
Designed July, 2021
Working Model, Not Fully Implemented

This project will focus on data storage and minipulation for users playing the game "Destiny 2". In this game, players collect items such as weapons, armor, and cosmetics. These items can be accessed online using an API, but there is no clear option to sort or search in a meaningful way. Players will want to save and store gear sets with specific stats, quickly find a weapon that has certain perks, and much more.

Data will be stored and tested via SQL workbench, hosted on a local server. Application will be web based, and will submit querries through Eclipse IDE utilizing Java. 
The web app will be able to add/delete/list items in real time to the SQL server.
